## Usage

The Nacromano Port Management System provides a user-friendly interface to manage ports, vehicles, and containers efficiently. Here are some key functionalities:

- **Port Management**: Add, update, and remove port information such as location, capacity, and name.

- **Vehicle Management**: Keep track of vehicles entering and leaving the port. Record vehicle details, including ID, type, and carry weight.

- **Container Management**: Monitor containers within the port. Create, update, and remove container records, including ID, weight and fuel consumption.
- And many more!

Our system provides a simple text-based interface to access these features. Follow the on-screen prompts to navigate through the options.
